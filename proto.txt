Available commands:

i: insert card
e: eject card
p: park arm (place it somewhere between insert and eject)
s: stop movement
w: "where" -- request current status of the robot
r: ready? (if so, robot will reply with "READY.\n")

The robot will always report state when the arm stops moving, with one of the
following:
"inserted\n": arm is inserted
"ejected\n": arm is ejected
"parked\n": the arm is somewhere between "inserted" and "ejected"

When the 'w' command is issued, the following are also possible:
"moving left\n": the engine is moving "leftwards".
"moving right\n": the engine is moving "rightwards".
"error\n": an error was detected.
"unknown state\n": Probably a programmer error.

What's "left" and "right" isn't defined, but it should be the same thing
as long as you don't change the wiring, or swap out the robot's engine.

What's "in" or "out" might change from one run to another, however.
